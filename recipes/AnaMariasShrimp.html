        <h2>Shriiiiimps!</h2>
        <p><strong>Who doesn't love shrimp, right?</strong> These little crustaceans have this unique flavor, they're great when fried, stewed, grilled, grilled, you name it. And for me, who grew up in a cultural environment with a strong Bahian and Caiçara influence, <strong>shrimp is a symbol of joy, abundance and celebration</strong>.<br><br>
        By the way, this is definitely not a Bahian recipe, nor a caiçara recipe. What about the parrot, you ask? No, no, this is not a pirates recipe either. In fact, I've always called this dish by another name: Ana Maria's shrimp. And I will explain why.</p>
        <h3>My first bite</h3>
        <p>Who introduced me to this delicacy was a great friend. At the time, heavily inspired by the movie Sideways, we used to cook dinners over wine. There were three of us, with an occasional extra guest. I was a professional cook at the time and I was always looking for new flavors. And, boy, was I delighted by this recipe that my friend introduced us to!
            <br><br>
            <strong>The dish consists of an unlikely combination: shrimp, cheese, mint and lemon</strong>. And yes, each ingredient must be markedly present. The only precaution is not to hide the delicacy of the shrimp and keep this game of flavors balanced.
            <br><br>
            In the first bite I had already imagined: the dish was loaded with umami from shrimp and cheese. But <strong>it is the unusual freshness of the mint with the pungency of the cheese and the acidity of the lemon that do the magic</strong> by allowing the shrimp to shine at different levels.
            <br><br>
            But why did I start calling this dish Ana Maria's shrimp and not Tarcísio's shrimp if that's the name of my cook friend? Because he discovered this recipe not in a renowned restaurant or in some secret cookbook, but when watching a very famous morning TV show in Brazil presented by a famous television celebrity: Ana Maria Braga.
            <br><br>
            Okay, but what about the parrot? It turns out that this show had a really fun mascot, a parrot puppet named Louro José. So, to keep the recipe name short and fun, but also to honor the puppeteer who died recently, I decided to name the recipe The Parrot's Shrimp. 
            <br><br>This is not my recipe. Not even Tarcisio. In fact, it's not even Ana Maria's, since she reproduced it from somewhere else. From where? I do not know. What I do know is that <strong>this is one of the most charming, unlikely and delicious combinations to make with shrimp</strong>.</p>
            <h2>I want that shrimp recipe!</h2>
            <p>This recipe can be a bit of a pain, so if you're a beginner, try to get someone's help. But if you're short on time, there are a few shortcuts that can help without compromising too much on the deliciousness of the dish.
                <br><br>
                In short: you can go the hard way or the easy way. Doing everything right, you will succeed in both. But <strong>nothing (NOTHING) compares to a dish made with fresh, organic ingredients</strong>. Therefore, first I will give you the way to make the recipe in the best way possible. Ready?</p>
            <h3>What you'll need for your Parrot's shrimp</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Shrimp</li>
                <li>Cheese sauce</li>
                <li>Mint</li>
                <li>Lemon</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
                <li>
                    <div class="papel">The hard way is the best way, but it is not the only way. <br>You can also get the shrimps already cleaned and the cheese sauce alredy made. Still yumy, but I'm not sure if that's something you'll be proud of. </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It seems pretty easy so far, I know. But the thing is: you have to prepare the shrimps properly. And besides that, you gotta know a few things to cook a tasty cheese sauce. These two preparations will demand time and techniques. But don't worry, I'll guide you through it.</p>

            <h4>These are the steps you got to accomplish</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Clean the shrimp(reserve the head and shell)</li>
                <li>Chop an onion, a tomato, some celery, garlic and carrot</li>
                <li>Saute the above ingredients for a few minutes then put the shrimp scraps inside with enough water to cover everything.<br>Let the shrimp sauce cook in low heat for 15 minutes, after that you can strain the liquid and reserve it</li>
                <li>Now for the cheese sauce. Pretty much, all you gotta do here is to cook a good bechamel and melt an excellent soft cheese like cheddar and gouda inside of it.</li>
                <li>Now mix everything together with a whole bunch of chopped mint and a whole squizid lemon. It should assume a velouté kind off sauce.</li>
            </ol>
